\usage{
LDS_BFGS(y, u, v, lambda = 1, ub, lb, num.restarts = 100,
  parallel = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{Input matrix for the state equation (m_u rows, T columns)}

\item{v}{Input matrix for the output equation (m_v rows, T columns)}

\item{ub}{Upper bounds, a vector whose length is the number of parameters}

\item{lb}{Lower bounds}

\item{num.restarts}{if init is not given then num.restarts must be provided. In this case the function
will randomize the initial value by sampling uniformly within the range for each parameters
(A in [0, 1], B in [-1, 1], C in [0, 1] and D in [-1, 1]).}

\item{parallel}{If TRUE, the computation is done in parallel using all available cores
(using the doParallel backend). If FALSE, the computation is done serially.}
